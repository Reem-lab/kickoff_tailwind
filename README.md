![Kickoff Tailwind](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/webcrunch/kt.jpg)

A free and simple starting point for Ruby on Rails 7 applications.. This particular template utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

### Included gems

- [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
- [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id)
- [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)
- [name_of_person](https://github.com/basecamp/name_of_person)
- [stripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby)
- [css-bundling](https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails) - now part of Rails 7

### Tailwind CSS by default

This template comes with Tailwind CSS preconfigured for use. To make use of tools like `@apply` and `@layer` a more sophisticated setup is required likely using PostCSS and JavaScript bundling.

## How it works

When creating a new rails app simply pass the template filename and ruby extension through. I opt for esbuild instead of the default importmap configuration for JavaScript.

```bash
$ rails new sample_app -j esbuild -m template.rb
```

### Once installed what do I get?

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwind.com) by default. You may [opt for Bootstrap, Bulma, Sass, and PostCSS](https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails#installation) but this will require manual changes to the existing markup in the generated template view files.
- [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) with a new `name` field already migrated in. The name field maps to the `first_name` and `last_name` fields in the database thanks to the [`name_of_person`](https://github.com/basecamp/name_of_person) gem.
- Enhanced views and devise views using Tailwind CSS.
- The [Stripe](https://rubygems.org/gems/stripe/) gem installed with the Stripe API to make accepting payments on the web. Be sure to add your own unique API keys.
- Support for Friendly IDs thanks to the handy [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id) gem. Note that you'll still need to do some work inside your models for this to work. This template installs the gem and runs the associated generator.
- Optional Foreman support. Run `.bin/dev` to kick off rails and Tailwind processes. Foreman needs to be installed as a global gem on your system for this to work. i.e. `gem install foreman`
- Custom view helper defaults for basic button and form elements.
- Scaffolding templates made with Tailwind CSS

### Boot it up
